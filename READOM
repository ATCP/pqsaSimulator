QUICK AND DIRTY
===============

There are three scripts, which are adjustGammaTofficer.py, avgthputdelay.py 
and copydata.py respectively. Scripts avgthputdelay.py and copydata.py are called by 
adjustGammaTofficer.py.
	sudo python adjustGammaTofficer.py


First, adjustGammaTofficer.py use of initial gamma and T as input, then it run pqsa 
simulator to get a file which store throughput and delay.

Second, When pqsa simulator completed, adjustGammaTofficer.py call script avgthputdelay.py 
to compute average throughput and average delay.

Third, adjustGammaTofficer.py will increase gamma if new throughput which get from 
avgthputdelay.py is more than old throughput and new delay is less than THRESHOLD(default 100ms), 
otherwise, reduce gamma. than use new gamma and T as input to run pqsa simulator.

There are two important functions in script adjustGammaTofficer.py, which are UpdateGammaAndT() 
and RunMulThread() respectively. Function UpdateGammaAndT() through return value(average throughput
and average delay) from avgthputdelay.py to compute gamma's or T's changing step, step maybe is a 
positive number, also can be a negative number. Function RunMulThread() call process_bw_level() to 
run pqsa simulator, have seven parameters: level, rate, window, period, _gamma, _t and trace.
